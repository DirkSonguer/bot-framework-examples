# bot-framework-examples

A number of sample projects for the Microsoft Bot Framework. All these are node.js based
and work locally against the emulator without any need to create a bot in the Bot Framework
Manager. Of course they can also run them live.

Note that each sub-project is meant as an easy example to showcase one specific aspect of
the bot framework.
